* Lead contributor to the development and maintenance of a geospatial data visualization application
  * Aided in translation of code from an existing MATLAB product to C# / .NET Core
  * Designed and implemented significant temporal analysis functionality on backend sever
  * Designed and implemented novel user-interface components for web client
  * Contributed to improved quality assurance (QA) procedures, including unit testing

## Technical Skills

* Programming Languages: C#, .NET, MATLAB, C++, Python, Java, SQL
* Operating Systems: macOS, Unix, Linux, Windows
* Tools: Visual Studio, Xcode, Git, Subversion

## Areas of Interest

* Data Science
* Machine learning
* Web / mobile applications

## Project Sought

* Web application dedicated to the parsing, storage, and display of recipes from numerous sources
  * Sources can include websites or scans of handwriting or other documents
  * Primary goal is to avoid per-source parsing strategy; machine learning and optical character recognition will be
    used to implement "generic" approach
  * Backed by relational database and REST API to present imported recipes to users
