#September 28th

*Started around 5:00pm

*There are 3 main portions of the project
*Each member will be assigned a portion 
**Other members should be up to date on all aspects of the project to be able to help
*Ben Hollar will go forward with most of the ML aspects, mostly research this semester. 
*Erin Graska will go forward with setting up a basic framework for the server-database relationship
*Stephanie Tam will focus on the user interaction portions of the system
*Created Task-List assignment
*Proposed features dependent on time:
**Grocery list - users can select recipes stored to be made and the app will autogenerate a list of ingrediaents needed for all of those recipes
***Possibly reflect this in the database mock-up, or at least make the relationships in the database such that this can be done without completely re-doing the design
**Sharing-users can share the stored recipes on different social media platforms as well as different messaging systems. 

*Ended around 8:45pm
