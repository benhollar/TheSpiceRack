# Stephanie Tam Final Assessment


## Part A

My contributions were made towards the user interface portion of our web application. This included:

* Creating a user friendly web application structure by incorporating good web design practices
* Identifying what features would be displayed on our web application pages
* Making sure that the information taken from the training data is also displayed

In the fall, I focused on looking at different CSS styles and recipe websites to see what their interface consisted of. I also did an EEP in the summer, where I had more experience with web design aspects using Bootstrap. Knowing HTML/CSS/Boostrap prior to this project helped a lot, so I was able to dive straight into creating a user friendly application without too much hassle.  

The main roadblock(s) I encountered was trying to make the elements I already had more aesthetically pleasing. I believe I struggled because I didn't decide on a specific wireframe for the user interface. This was the most time consuming part, I would say, because I spent a lot of time going back and forth between using a certain navigation bar layout, or trying to figure out what colors would go well with each other.  The nice thing about CSS is that changes are easy to spot usually, but there were times where I had trouble getting a certain element to show up.  A lot of my time was spent tweaking small bits of the web page, which might have been less stressful had I had a wireframe to go off of. 

Despite spending majority of my time tweaking and wishing I had a plan prior, I would say that I was able to find a layout that was simple, yet not too plain. I was able to use Bootstrap elements to create a webpage that displays the recipe's photos. Upon hovering, the user will be able to view or edit the recipe after being redirected to the page. If a user manually enters the recipes, it is pretty simple to extract images and information and display it in a recipe template. But since we were using machine learning to extract data from recipe URLs, I had to make sure that the data taken from those URLs would be displayed similarly to the recipes manually added.


## Part B

All of our original goals listed were accomplished:

1. Parsing a variety of sources of recipes (websites, handwritten recipes) into a common, easy-to-read format.
2. Storing user recipes, including automatically imported recipes from the previously mentioned parser.
3. Presenting an effective user-interface for navigating stored recipes

At the expo, we were able to present a demo of or web application, which allowed a user to store recipes manually, and import recipes from online sources using machine-learning content extraction. 

We did have a stretch goal of incorporating optical character recognition, which we unfortunately did not have time to explore and demo. We decided that this would be one of our future possibilities, along with expanding our training data scope.  Overall, I think our group worked really well as a team. It helped a lot that we were all friends/groupmates prior, so communicating with each other was fairly easy. We all pulled our own weight by completing our tasks assigned at the beginning, and we stayed accountable by meeting up virtually a few times in the past few months. We did slack off a bit towards the beginning, but I am very proud of our group for creating something that we could demo at the expo.
