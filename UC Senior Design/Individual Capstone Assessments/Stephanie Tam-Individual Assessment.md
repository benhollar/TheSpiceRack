# Stephanie Tam Capstone Assessment


## Introduction

Using machine learning and character recognition, my team and I plan on creating a recipe storage and parsing application. This includes (but is not limited to) handwritten recipes, or even recipes from other third-party sites. We will achieve this by having a database web application that will collect recipes specified by the user. Our overall goal is to create something that will allow a user to find different recipes efficiently and effectively. From an academic perspective, this project will allow myself and my teammates to apply what we have learned throughout our years at UC. Many of the courses in the Computer Science curriculum will be a useful guide in creating our product. 

## Experiences

This project will involve topics relevant to the courses our team has/are taking as a part of the Computer Science curriculum: Machine Learning, User Interfaces, Information Retrieval, Relational Database fundamentals, Software QA and Testing, and Requirements Engineering. These topics are relevant to the production of our web application. Knowledge in information retrieval and machine learning will be mainly useful to parse recipes from third party websites. User interface concepts will allow us to build a effective and interactive applicaiton. Requirements engineering and Software QA and Testing will apply towards creating requirements for our project deliverables and eventually implementing testing techniques to our project next semester.
The usage of Algorithms, Python, and Data Structures are likely to be applied towards our project. 


My past co-op experiences will also play a large role in this project. I have worked two semester at Medpace as a Clinical Database Programming Co-Op. I was tasked with verifying forms that would be used in the Imaging department. Though I was an Information Technology Co-Op at BSI Engineering in Fall 2019, I was tasked with creating a database inventory manager as my final project. Due to Covid-19, my original co-op term this summer at BSI Engineering was cancelled. However, I was able to work on an EEP that focused on Web Development/Design. I was able to successfully obtain certification in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Responsive Design through University of Michigans Coursera course. Using the technical skills I have acquired from my co-ops and recently through my EEP, I will be able to work more closely with the Front-End Development of our Recipe Book. My work experiences also allowed me to work more confidently in teams, and also be more confident in communicating with others. 


## Motivation and Initial Approach:

As stated in the project description, our motivation was wanting to create a way for users to find and collect recipes effectively and efficiently. By effectively and efficiently, we want to avoid having different ad popups or descriptions. 

Like Ben, I have also been cooking more at home due to COVID-19. Because of this (and my lack of proper cooking skills), I have resorted to many recipes online. My mom, for example, would test out different recipes she found from Youtube, and sometimes she would adjust or combine two different recipes together. Most of her recipes are written down on paper, which can be tedious to sort through. After discussing our cooking dilemas, we decided to create a website that will: 

1. Parse handwritten or typed recipes as accurately as possible.
2. Use a machine learning model to gather recipes from a websites raw HTML.
3. Having an interactive user interface that can parse certain recipes, while having a polished and efficient look.

To evaluate myself, I will set goals for myself and the team. I define success as keeping myself and my teammates accountable, so as long as we stay on task and reach each of our milestones by our set deadlines, our contributions will be equally as successful.
