# Final Assessment

<!--
The purpose of the Self-Assessment and the Team-Assessment is to reflect on all your personal and group accomplishments
in Senior Design. 

Part A - Two Paragraphs: 
What was your individual contribution to this project? Did you apply and build upon the skills identified in your
initial assessment from last Fall? What did you do and how did you do it? What did you learn and what competencies did
you build? What were your successes, what were you obstacles?

Part B – Two Paragraphs: 
What did your group accomplish? What did you learn about group work? What aspects of teamwork were successful and what
aspects of teamwork were not successful? How did your efforts on the project compare to that of your teammates?  Do any
team members deserve special recognition?

## Part A

My contribution to The Spice Rack focused mainly on developing our machine-learning models which formed the foundational
functionality that our web application -- primarily built by my team members -- designed and created. In order to
develop the machine-learning model, there were a number of tasks to complete:

* Data collection and structuring
* Identification of frameworks, models to build on that were appropriate for our task
* Integration of our custom dataset with those frameworks
* Model training and testing, including tweaking parameters for increased performance

Summarily, _most_ of my work revolved around the first task, though the latter steps were just as important. Data
collection, in particular, posed a challenge -- it took quite some time to gather just 360 recipes to train on, which is
a fairly insubstantial amount of data to train a model on. If there were any individual task to label as an obstacle, it
would be that one, simply due to time management constraints.

The rest of my work I'd say was quite successful. I was able to devise a model to extract relevant content from webpages
and an entirely separate model to classify the text such that we could identify which line-by-line where the recipe's
title, ingredients, and instructions were contained in that extracted content. I did this by building upon the skills I
identified in the fall, most especially my Deep Learning and Information Retrieval knowledge learned from UC courses of
the same names.

## Part B

My group accomplished all of our original goals, detailed in our abstract:

> Finding and collecting recipes can be a daunting task, and many online recipe sources distract users with unnecessary
> blogs or advertisements. The Spice Rack aims to reduce that problem by providing a web application where users can
> store their recipes without distractions and import recipes from online sources using a machine-learning driven
> content extraction process.

Namely, we designed a web application that can import recipes parsed by a machine-learning-backed algorithm.

Regarding our efforts as a team, I think we worked together effectively, and spent relatively even amounts of effort in
making the project become reality. I think one of the strengths of my team is that we are all good friends, and working
with friends made it easier to stay in touch and hold each other accountable. As one might expect during a pandemic,
staying motivated was a constant challenge, but it's one I think my team overcame well.
