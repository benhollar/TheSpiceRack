| ------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Research of machine learning strategies / tooling | 5      |
| Data Aggregation for Model Training               | 25     |
| Required Assignments                              | 5      |

As can be seen above, the majority of my time was spent collecting data to train ML models with, while also contributing
to my team's scheduled meetings and assignments required by the class portion of the Senior Design project.

## Spring 2021

| Machine Learning Training / Implementation        | 20     |
| Application Testing                               | 5      |
| Required Assignments                              | 5      |

In the Spring, I continued working on collecting data, then quickly transitioned to implementing 2 ML models that were
crucial to our project's functionality. The implementation / training took some time as I worked on tuning parameters to
achieve the best results we could. I also continued to meet with my team members and contribute to required
assignments as needed, and to test our project prior to the demo.
